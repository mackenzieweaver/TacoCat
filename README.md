### Cats aren't tacos
Taco Cat is a palindrome challenge in disguise. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same way forwards as it is backwards. 

### The live site
You can find my implementation [here](https://mackenzie-weaver-tacocat.netlify.app/)

### Continuous Deployment
My solution is continuously deployed to netlify so that when I push code to github my live site is automatically updated.

### Implementation
Simply go to the "Solution" tab and enter a word to see if it's a palindrome or not. 
There are different forms of taco cat and some of them let you input captial letters as well as lower case letters,
some allow you to enter numbers while others do not, and still others allow special characters while some don't.
My solution allows to you enter any character you want, but provides checkboxes to filter the input whether you want to 
allow certain characters or not. 

### Output
I also provide clear output areas for both the reversed version of the word or phrase as well.
Lastly if you would check your browsers console after playing with the app you will find
all of the words you have tried stored in JSON format as a form of search history.
